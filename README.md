# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

This app was intended to be a work day scheduler.

I've run into an issue where due to the way the CSS/HTML is overlapping, users can't click into any form fields besides the form for the last hour.

Its possible through some shift-tabbing to 'select' under the offending elements, but after much time spent searching and trying answers I've failed.

This is the assignment as far as I was able to take it. If I could have spent that time differently I'd have just removed the CSS altogether and made the scheduler work in a functional manner.
